# Hockey-Club-Varna
I am happy to share that I've developed the website of our hockey club.
I had the idea to focus on interactive design and a friendly interface that makes it easy to navigate and use for any user.
The website provides information about the club and its events, supporting communication between the fans.
I'm planning on changing the entire website by using React, Tailwind and Flowbite for the UI.

I have added reasons why to chose us like: <br/>
• Motivation 
• Skating
• Exercises.
